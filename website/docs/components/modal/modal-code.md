@## Basic use of the modal window

@example modal

@## The height of the modal window is bigger the browser page

Sometimes the amount of content overfills the window's visibility, but you don't need to worry about it, because the component will be adjusted and the scroll will appear.

@example scroll

@## Changing the alignment

By default, the modal window is displayed in the center, sometimes we need to change the window when the content height inside the window is resized and the modal window begins to "jump". This can be done by making the desired indent on the respective side.

@example position

@## Modal window in a modal window

We do not recommend this, but sometimes it is necessary to open a model window in another modal window. You should put modal windows in each other, so that the background and keyboard navigation would be correct.

@example modal-inside-modal

@## Modal window with customization

Example of a wizard üßôüèª requiring a custom header.

@example wizard

@## Access to internal HTML nodes
To access the background or the closing cross, you need to expand the modal window and recreate the same sequence of components.

We hope that in most cases you won't need it. **No custom cross is needed:**

- send Analytics by click (**solution**: apply [`onClose`](/components/modal/modal-api/#aa518f) in Modal)
- the spinner needs to overlap the cross (solution: take a look at the [example](/components/modal/modal-code/#adf9fc) above)

@example modal-advanced
