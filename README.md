# Intergalactic üê≥

Intergalactic is a [React](https://reactjs.org/) component library for developing interfaces.

## Before you start

This repository is a single development point for all library components. Each component is a separate package located in the `@semcore` namespace.

You can add our components to your project using any package manager.

## How to contribute to the project

All changes, including changes by the project participants, must go through a code review. We do that in merge
